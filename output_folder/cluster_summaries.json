{"cluster":{"0":0,"1":1,"2":2},"ClusterSummary":{"0":"1. **Cluster Title**: SurrealDB Denial-of-Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities\n\n2. **Cluster Description**: This cluster of advisories highlights several Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerabilities within SurrealDB. The common theme among these advisories is the ability of authenticated users to exploit various functions and features to exhaust system resources, leading to server crashes or unresponsiveness. The vulnerabilities include CPU exhaustion via custom functions, memory exhaustion through string replacements and nested functions, and unbounded execution time for JavaScript functions. Additionally, there are issues with improper handling of HTTP queries and uncaught exceptions that can crash the database. These vulnerabilities were discovered during a code audit and penetration test by cure53, with varying severity levels from Low to Critical.\n\n3. **Suggested Actions**:\n   - **Upgrade SurrealDB**: Ensure all instances are updated to versions 2.0.5, 2.1.5, 2.2.2, or later, which contain patches for these vulnerabilities.\n   - **Restrict Function Usage**: Use the `--deny-functions` flag or `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_FUNC` environment variable to limit the execution of custom functions, especially those that are untrusted.\n   - **Limit Scripting Capabilities**: Disable scripting functions using the `--deny-scripting` flag or `SURREAL_CAPS_DENY_SCRIPT=true` environment variable to prevent exploitation of unbounded execution time.\n   - **Implement Resource Limits**: Configure environment variables such as `SURREAL_GENERATION_ALLOCATION_LIMIT` and `SURREAL_SCRIPTING_MAX_TIME_LIMIT` to enforce limits on memory allocation and execution time.\n   - **Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure proper sanitization of inputs at the application layer to prevent injection attacks that could exploit these vulnerabilities.\n   - **Monitor and Restart**: Set up monitoring and automatic restart mechanisms for SurrealDB instances to mitigate the impact of crashes and ensure continuous availability.\n\n4. **Summary**: The identified DoS vulnerabilities in SurrealDB can severely impact server availability and performance. By upgrading to patched versions, restricting function and scripting capabilities, implementing resource limits, and ensuring input sanitization, administrators can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. These actions are crucial for maintaining the integrity and availability of SurrealDB instances, especially in environments where it serves as a backend for applications.\n\n5. **Data References**:\n   - **SurrealDB CPU exhaustion via custom functions**: [SurrealQL Documentation - DEFINE FUNCTION Statement](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealql\/statements\/define\/function)\n   - **SurrealDB no JavaScript script function default timeout**: [SurrealQL Documentation - Scripting Functions](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealql\/functions\/script)\n   - **SurrealDB memory exhaustion via string::replace using regex**: [SurrealQL Documentation - DB Functions (string::replace)](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealql\/functions\/database\/string#stringreplace)\n   - **SurrealDB server-takeover via SurrealQL injection on backup import**: [SurrealDB Documentation - Export](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealdb\/cli\/export)\n   - **SurrealDB has local file read of 2-column TSV files via analyzers**: [SurrealQL Documentation - DEFINE ANALYZER](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealql\/statements\/define\/analyzer#define-analyzer-statement)\n   - **SurrealDB vulnerable to memory exhaustion via nested functions and scripts**: [SurrealQL Documentation - Scripting Functions](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealql\/functions\/script)\n   - **SurrealDB has uncaught exception in Net module that leads to database crash**: [SurrealDB Documentation - Capabilities](https:\/\/surrealdb.com\/docs\/surrealdb\/security\/capabilities)","1":"1. **Cluster Title**: Resource Management and Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities\n\n2. **Cluster Description**: This cluster of security advisories highlights critical issues related to resource management and privilege escalation across various software systems.
