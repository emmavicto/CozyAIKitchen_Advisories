      "2. **Cluster Description**: The advisories highlight multiple vulnerabilities in SurrealDB, a database management system, that can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and unauthorized access. Common themes include the exploitation of SurrealDB's scripting and function capabilities, which allow attackers to exhaust system resources such as CPU and memory. Additionally, improper handling of network requests and file access permissions can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and unauthorized file access. These vulnerabilities are primarily due to insufficient input validation, lack of proper resource limits, and inadequate sanitization of user inputs, which can be exploited by authenticated users with specific permissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Suggested Actions**:\n",
      "   - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user inputs, especially in functions and scripts. Reference: [SurrealQL Documentation - Scripting Functions](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/functions/script).\n",
