      "\n",
      "2. **Cluster Description**: The advisories in this cluster highlight multiple Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities within SurrealDB. These vulnerabilities stem from various sources, including CPU exhaustion via custom functions, memory exhaustion through nested functions and scripts, uncaught exceptions in the Net module, and the absence of default timeouts for JavaScript script functions. Authenticated users with specific permissions can exploit these vulnerabilities to monopolize server resources, crash the database, or cause infinite recursion, leading to server unresponsiveness and requiring manual intervention for recovery. The common theme across these advisories is the potential for authenticated users to disrupt the availability of SurrealDB services through resource-intensive operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Suggested Actions**:\n",
      "   - **Patch Management**: Ensure SurrealDB is updated to versions 2.0.5, 2.1.5, 2.2.2, or later to mitigate these vulnerabilities.\n",

      "   - **Automatic Restart**: Ensure the SurrealDB process is configured to automatically restart after a crash to minimize downtime.\n",

By implementing the suggested actions, including patch management, function and script restrictions, timeout configurations, resource monitoring, automatic restart, and input sanitization, administrators can significantly mitigate the risk of these attacks.

      "2. **Cluster Description**: The advisories in this cluster reveal a common theme of resource exhaustion and privilege escalation vulnerabilities across various software systems. These issues stem from improper process management, inadequate validation of user inputs, and insufficient access control mechanisms. For instance, Pleezer's uncollected hook script processes lead to resource exhaustion, while Argo Events users can gain privileged access through EventSource and Sensor custom resources. Similarly, gorilla/csrf's broken Referer validation allows CSRF attacks, and Directus exposes access tokens in logs. These vulnerabilities highlight the critical need for robust process cleanup, stringent validation, and secure logging practices to prevent exploitation and ensure system integrity.\n",
